# Superior Dining
* **Event:** BepisCTF (ISSS CTF 09-06-2016)
* **Problem Type:** Misc
* **Point Value / Difficulty:** TBD
* **Tools Used:**
    * Whitespace Interpreter - There are tons of online whitespace interpreters, just google whitespace interpreter.

## Background
Whitespace is one of many [_esoteric programming languages_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), a.k.a esolangs. These languages are _proof-of-concepts_ and not actually (usually) used outside of being gimmicks. Conversely, they make a good tool to hide information in unsuspecting locations, a practice called Stegonography.

## Steps
### Run the file in an interpreter
A quick _Whitespace Interpreter_ Google search will result in a ton of options. I am using [this](https://naokikp.github.io/wsi/whitespace.html) one. Just paste the contents of the challange (pasted below) into an interpreter to produce the flag.

## Resources
### Challenge File
The file can be found [here](https://hastebin.com/mewerupemi.md) post CTF.
