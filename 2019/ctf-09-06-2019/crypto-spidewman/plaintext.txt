Awwight, peopwe, wet’s do this one wast time. My name is Petew B. Pawkew. I was bitten by a wadioactive spidew. And fow the wast twenty-two yeaws, I thought I was the one and onwy Spidew-Man. I’m pwetty suwe you know the west. You see, I saved the city, feww in wove, I got mawwied, saved the city some mowe, maybe too much, my mawwiage got testy, made some dicey money choices, don’t invest in a Spidew-themed westauwant. Then wike fifteen yeaws passed, bwah, bwah, bwah, supew bowing, I bwoke my back, a dwone fwew into my face, I buwied Aunt May, my wife and I spwit up. But I handwed it wike a champion. ‘Cause you know what? No mattew how many times I get hit, I awways get back up. And I got a wot of time to wefwect and wowk on mysewf. Did you know that seahowses that they mate fow wife? Couwd you imagine a seahowse seeing anothew seahowse and then making it wowk? She wanted kids and... and it scawed me. I'm pwetty suwe I bwoke hew heawt. Fwash fowwawd, I'm in my apawtment doing push-ups, doing ab cwunches, getting stwong, when this weiwd thing happened. And I gotta say, weiwd things happen to me a wot. But this was weaw weiwd. You see, I was in New Yowk, but the things wewe diffewent. Awso I was dead. And bwonde. I was kind of pewfect. It was wike wooking in a miwwow. I have a feewing that the thing that bwought me hewe, was the thing that got him kiwwed. You wanna know what happened next? Me too. Anyway, hewe's the flag utflag{petew_b_pawkew}
