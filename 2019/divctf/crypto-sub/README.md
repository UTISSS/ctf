## Stepsâ€‹
#### Step 1
You're presented with some text that looks really garbled, but the title of the challenge suggests it might be a substitution cipher.

#### Step 2
The quickest way to solve a substitution cipher is by using an online tool, like [this](https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver) one! It makes your life really easy :) Once you plug in the whole ciphertext (you can't just plug in the last line by itself, because then the frequency counting that is used to solved the cipher will not be accurate), you will get the flag: `utflag{submarine_cipher}`.
