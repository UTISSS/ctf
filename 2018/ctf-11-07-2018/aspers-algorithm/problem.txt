Asper aspires to break an ASP.NET application. So, Asper hacked into an asplication about asparagus to test this aspiration.

Asper managed to get the secret key out, but he needed to send the secret message to his server back home. In order to do so, he invented his own custom way of doing it:

Asper generated a humanly-generated random bitstring B by spamming ones and zeros on his keyboard. He then XORed this bitstring bit-by-bit with his message A to get an "encrypted" message C. Finally, he threw B and C in a file with 49998 other bitstrings randomly generated by a computer program. Asper claims he can get his message back once the file is sent to his server (it's not very efficient, but it works, OK).

Anyways, Asper's algorithms always attack applications admirably, although, Asper admits an astute adversary's advantage. Someone else (like us!) can still figure out what his message is. Can you figure it out?

Hint: pay attention to how we describe each random bitstring is generated.
