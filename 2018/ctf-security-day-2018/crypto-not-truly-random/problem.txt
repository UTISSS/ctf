Title: Truly Arbitrary

Humorous Han has broken into Trusting Tesia's home base and stolen some information. He needs to send this secret message to one of his friends back home, while making it impossible for anyone to detect. So, he's invented a new way of hiding the information:

First, Humorous Han creates a "random" bitstring (call this B) by spamming zeros and ones on his keyboard. Then, he XORs B bit-by-bit with his message, A, to get his encrypted message C. Finally, he throws B and C into a file with fifty thousand other bitstrings randomly generated by a computer program.

(It's not the most efficient technique, okay).

Humorous Han's friend knows a trick based on this method that'll let him easily recover the message when it gets home.

Fortunately, we've intercepted Humorous Han's message, but unfortunately, we don't know what this trick is, or anything about how to recover his message. Can you figure it out?

Hint: Not all randoms are created equal.
