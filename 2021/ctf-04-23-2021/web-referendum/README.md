# Web: Rigged Referendum
This problem points users to a vote between a few different flags. The prompt 
is supposed to hint that the users might be able to break the election. Since 
vote validation is being done client-side in JavaScript, you can simply modify 
the website's code using "Inspect Element" to allow arbitrarily large numbers 
of votes. Changing the results of the election causes the flag to be printed.

## Prompt
Looks like a flag referendum is going on! 
I wonder if I could rig the vote...
