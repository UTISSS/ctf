# Repeated RSA
Our security engineers at the Death Sun realized that generating big prime numbers for our RSA-encrypted channels is _hard work_. So they came up with an ingenious idea! It can't hurt to reuse a prime every once in a while, can it? Saves us some computational power. Man, those engineers are some real smart folk.
