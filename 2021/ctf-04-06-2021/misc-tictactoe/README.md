# Misc: Tic-Tac-Toe
This problem lets you play tic-tac-toe against an AI, 
which will always win or tie in a normal game. However,
the hint encourages you to *think outside the box*, which 
is supposed to lead you to find out that you can make moves 
outside the normal 9 squares. For example, you can play 
squares 3, 6, and 9 to win the game and get the flag.

## Prompt
I've stolen alien technology to develop the ultimate
tic-tac-toe AI. Can you beat it?
