# Web: Robot HQ 1
This problem prompts you to find out what the robots are "saying". 
The first hint is meant to point you towards reading the page's 
source, which includes some code that starts a websocket connection, 
and asks what the flag is. The second hint points you towards the 
"Network" tab of your browser's developer console, which lets you 
inspect the websockets conversation and identify the flag.

## Prompt
I found my way into the robots' HQ, can you figure out what 
they're saying?

## Hint
Try _inspecting_ for a clue to find where the robots are talking.

Make sure you inspect the _network_ as well!
