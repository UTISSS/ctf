## How To Solve
There are just 2 main steps here to decode this flag
.
#### step 1 - convert from binary
This is easy enough and you can even be done with the help of a website, https://cryptii.com/pipes/binary-decoder is good.

#### Step 2 - rot
the second and lst step is to just use a rot decoder, which again you can use the help of a website to do. The one I used was https://tech.pookey.co.uk/non-wp/rot-decoder.php and is pretty nice as it shows you different ROT-N at once. If you end up using this sight you should see the flag at ROT16.
