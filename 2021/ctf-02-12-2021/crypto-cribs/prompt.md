I'm going to buy a lot of cribs from Target to raise their stock price, but I got locked out of my brokerage account and forgot my password. Fortunately, I found some files that I think contain my password. Unfortunately, the files are encrypted. I used a one time pad, and I can't find the key. I've included the hex encoded contents of the files.
