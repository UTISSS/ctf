# Networking: Robbin' Good
In this problem, you're given access to a page that checks whether the flag 
is correct. The first hint is supposed to give away that there is a timing 
side channel in this problem; the more characters are correct in the flag, 
the longer it takes the server to respond. Using this fact, you can guess 
the flag one character at a time by iterating over all the possible 
characters specified in the second hint.

## Prompt
My friends and I are setting up our new startup online, where you will be 
able to trade stocks securely and easily; check it out!
