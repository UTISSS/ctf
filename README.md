# ISSS CTF Challenges

This repository contains a copy of the problems created for each of our CTF contests. This includes:
* The CTFs ISSS runs every few weeks locally at UT
* CTFs for larger events, such as HackTXCTF or Security Day CTF
* Online CTFs run nationally and internationally

Feel free to consult this repository and try challenges yourself! We usually keep challenges running for a few days after the events on ctf.isss.io, but once those are down they'll be moved here.

If you'd like to contact any of the officers about these challenges, you can reach us through our website, [isss.io](http://isss.io).
