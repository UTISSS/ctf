# Forensics: Monster Hash
This problem gives an audio file, in which a section of the song 
appears to be corrupted. The hint is supposed to suggest looking 
at the audio file's _spectrogram_, which shows you a 2-dimensional 
heatmap of the audio's frequency spectrum over time. One way to 
inspect the spectrogram of an audio file is to use a free audio 
editing tool such as Audacity. In Audacity, you can view an audio 
file's spectrogram by opening it, clicking on the track's name on 
the left, and changing from the "Waveform" to "Spectrogram". Then 
you can zoom in on the section of the file that looks very different 
from the rest of the file, and the flag is revealed.

## Prompt
I think a ghost is living in part of my favorite song! 
Can you find the ghost in the file?
