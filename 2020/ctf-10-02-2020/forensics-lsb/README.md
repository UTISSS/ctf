# Forensics: Insignificant Meme
The flag is encoded using [this website](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/), 
which encodes the message in the least-significant bits of the image's pixels.

## Prompt
I keep losing to crewmates sending links to memes in chat. 
I think the memes are hiding secret messages, but I can't find out what they're saying.
Can you help me decode the message?
