# Networking: Impostors Only
In this challenge, a pcap file is given, which contains a login over HTTP 
to the site `ctf.isss.io:4261/login`. The login can be used at the same site to 
login and see the flag.

## Prompt
I was sniffing my friend's internet traffic to try to discover imposter secrets, 
but most of his traffic was encrypted. Can you find the imposter secret for me?
