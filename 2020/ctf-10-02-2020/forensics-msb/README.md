# Forensics: Corrupt Memes
The file given has a message encoded in the most significant bit of every pixel.
The bits are encoded high to low, character-by-character, down the rows of the image. 
You have to write a custom script to decode the message; an example is provided.

## Prompt
After I figured out how the crewmates were sending messages through images in chat, 
they changed how they were encoding their messages. Now the images look like they've 
been corrupted or something. Can you help me decode their new messages?
