# Web: Resource Getter
In this challenge, the website appears to request any URL that you give it, and return the result.
Using this, you can use a file:// URL to recover the flag at /flag.txt.

## Prompt
I'm usually too lazy to fetch my own URLs, so I made this cool webapp to do it for me.
My flag is stored locally on my computer, so you shouldn't be able to find it.
In fact I'm so sure that you can't find it, that I'll tell you the filepath: `/flag.txt`

## Hint
Websites aren't the only thing you can put in a URL...

## Flag
`utflag{g0t_y0ur_r3s0urc3!}`
