# Web: Cookie Jar
In this problem the website serves an access denied page. 
The theme is supposed to inspire checking the site's cookies, which reveals a
cookie `isCookieMonster` that is set to false. Modifying the cookie to be true 
opens the jar and reveals the flag.

## Prompt
I'm trying to open this jar of cookies, but the website doesn't recognize me.
Can you open the jar for me and inspect the cookies?

## Hint
Inspect Element -> Storage
(only possible in Chrome/Firefox)

## Flag
`utflag{c0ngrat5_tak3_a_byt3}`
