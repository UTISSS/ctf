## Steps​
#### Step 1
The prompt mentions that I mistyped some of the letters on my keyboard when I was trying to send a message. That hint combined with the title will hopefully lead you to the [keyboard cipher](http://howtodothat.wikidot.com/how-to-use-the-keyboard-cipher).

#### Step 2
You can either look at your keyboard to see which way the shift is (since you know the flag begins with `utflag{}`), or you can use [this](https://www.cross-browser.com/toys/qwertyshifter.html) handy tool.
